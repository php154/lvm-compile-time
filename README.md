LLVM Compile Time Tracker
=========================

This repository contains infrastructure for tracking LLVM compile-time performance over time. This includes both server code that performs measurements and publishes to the [llvm-compile-time-data](https://github.com/nikic/llvm-compile-time-data) repository, as well as display code for the website at http://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/.

Everything in here is something of a hack and not designed for general usage.
